## Employee Records Management System - Populus

The main objective of this project is to create a web based online employee records management system (ERMS) that is accessible everywhere across platforms and with the features explained below. The proposed name for the ERMS is Populus. Recording employee data manually has been centuries old and it is still practiced in this modern day world. With the
advent of computers, everything is being digitized. But this has been a slow step for the employee records management. This simply may be due to the fact that companies (especially
small to medium enterprises or companies) do not have the technical means to do it. Or it might be expensive, so much so that it puts the companies off. Populus is an online system (which can be self hosted for security purposes) that can keep the records of the employees and company data safe.

###### Modules
Populus has different modules for each task or purpose.
Populus will have the following modules:
1. Dashboard module
2. Profile module
3. Work Module
4. Files Module
5. Employees Module
6. Assets Module
7. Salary Module

###### Populus uses the MERN stack of technologies. MERN is a JavaScript based stack.
This means Populus uses:
1. MongoDB - as the database
2. Express JS - as the HTTP server
3. React JS - as the front-end UI library
4. Node JS - as the backend runtime environment for the Javascript code to run on.
